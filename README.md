Although this project is called TGUI-DarkTheme, there is also an equivalent Light Theme, the only difference being the colours. Padding, borders, etc. are the same.

There are two ways of using the themes in this project:
1. load from the txt files
2. load using the theme classes that are included

Both ways of loading produce the same theme.
